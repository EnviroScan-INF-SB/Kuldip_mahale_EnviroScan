# 🧹 Module 2: Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

## Overview
This module focuses on preparing and enhancing raw environmental datasets for accurate machine learning predictions.  
The process ensures clean, standardized, and feature-rich data ready for model training.

## 🔧 Steps Involved

### 1. Remove Duplicates and Invalid Records
- Eliminate duplicate entries from raw datasets.
- Filter out invalid or out-of-range sensor readings.

### 2. Handle Missing Values
- Use **interpolation** or **mean/median imputation** for missing data points.
- Maintain dataset integrity without biasing results.

### 3. Standardize Data Formats
- Standardize **timestamps**, **GPS coordinates**, and **pollutant units** (e.g., µg/m³, ppm).
- Ensure consistency across multiple data sources.

### 4. Normalize Feature Values
- Apply normalization or scaling to pollutant and weather variables.
- Achieve consistent input scaling for machine learning models.

### 5. Generate Spatial Features
- Calculate spatial proximity metrics such as:
  - Distance to the nearest **road**
  - Distance to **industrial zones**
  - Distance to **dump sites** or **waste centers**

### 6. Derive Temporal Features
- Extract time-based features to capture pollution patterns:
  - **Hour of day**
  - **Day of week**
  - **Month or season**

### 7. Integrate All Data Sources
- Merge pollution, weather, and spatial data into a unified **feature-rich DataFrame**.
- Serve as the final input for model training and analysis.
